12. Debugging techniques
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in your code. Here are some debugging techniques you can use in PHP:

Use var_dump() or print_r() to output the values of variables and arrays.
Use error_reporting() to control the level of error reporting.
Use a PHP debugger such as Xdebug or Zend Debugger to step through your code and inspect variables.
Use logging libraries such as Monolog to log errors and other events in your application.
Error reporting and logging
PHP provides several functions for reporting and logging errors. Here are some examples:

error_reporting(): Sets the level of error reporting.
ini_set(): Sets the value of a configuration option at runtime.
trigger_error(): Generates a user-level error message.
Using try/catch blocks
Try/catch blocks allow you to catch and handle exceptions in your code. Here's an example:

php

try {
  // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (Exception $e) {
  // Code to handle the exception
}
In this example, the code inside the try block is executed. If an exception is thrown, the code inside the catch block is executed instead.

Handling exceptions
Exceptions are a way to handle errors and other exceptional events in your code. Here are some best practices for working with exceptions in PHP:

Use custom exception classes to provide more context about the exception.
Use try/catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
Log exceptions to help with debugging.
Use finally blocks to clean up resources, such as closing database connections.
