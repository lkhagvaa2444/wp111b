Install a web server: A web server is software that allows you to serve web pages over the internet. Apache and Nginx are popular web servers that work well with PHP. You can download and install them from their respective websites.

Install a database server: PHP is often used with a database to store and retrieve data. MySQL and PostgreSQL are popular database servers that work well with PHP. You can download and install them from their respective websites.

Choose an IDE or text editor: An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development. Some popular IDEs for PHP are Visual Studio Code, PhpStorm, and Eclipse. If you prefer a text editor, you can use Notepad++, Sublime Text, or Atom.

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start programming in PHP.
