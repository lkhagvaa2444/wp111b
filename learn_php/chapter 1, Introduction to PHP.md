1. Introduction to PHP
PHP is a server-side scripting language that is used to create dynamic web pages. It was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 and has since become one of the most widely used languages for web development.

PHP is an open-source language, which means that anyone can download and use it for free. It is also a cross-platform language, which means that it can run on any operating system.

In this course, we will cover the basics of PHP programming, including setting up a development environment, basic syntax and data types, control structures, functions, arrays, strings, working with files, object-oriented programming, connecting to databases, building a web application, and debugging and error handling.
