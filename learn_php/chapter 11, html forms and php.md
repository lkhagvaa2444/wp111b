11. HTML forms and PHP
HTML forms are often used to collect user input in web applications. PHP can be used to process the data submitted through the form. Here's an example:

php

<form action="process.php" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username">
  <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
In this example, the form data is sent to a PHP script called process.php using the post method. The PHP script can then retrieve the values of the form fields using the $_POST superglobal.

bash

$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];
Sessions and cookies
Sessions and cookies are commonly used in PHP to maintain state between requests. Sessions allow you to store data on the server, while cookies allow you to store data on the client. Here's an example of how to use sessions in PHP:

bash

session_start();

$_SESSION['username'] = 'john';

echo 'Hello, ' . $_SESSION['username'];
In this example, the session_start() function is called to start a session. The $_SESSION superglobal is then used to store a value, which can be accessed on subsequent requests.

Authentication and authorization
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is the process of determining whether a user has permission to perform a certain action. PHP provides several functions and libraries for implementing authentication and authorization in your web application.

Creating RESTful APIs with PHP
RESTful APIs are a common way to allow third-party applications to interact with your web application. PHP can be used to create RESTful APIs using frameworks such as Slim, Lumen, or Laravel.
